The only PR tracker that honks at you when you're the bottleneck. Now shipping with 100% more goose noises!

Lives in your menubar like a tiny waterfowl of productivity shame, watching your GitHub PRs and making aggressive bird sounds when you're blocking someone's code from seeing the light of production.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL**: This is very much a work in progress. The blocking logic has bugs. It theoretically runs on Linux, BSD, and Windows but we've literally never tested it there. Here be dragons (and geese).

## What It Does

- **ü™ø Honks** when you're blocking someone's PR (authentic goose noises included)
- **üöÄ Rocket sounds** when own your own PR is ready to go to the next stage
- **üß† Smart turn-based assignment** - knows who is blocking a PR, knows when tests are failing, etc.
- **‚≠ê Auto-start** on login (macOS)

## macOS Quick Start ‚ö° (How to Get Honked At)

Install dependencies: the [GitHub CLI, aka "gh"](https://cli.github.com/) and [Go](https://go.dev/):

```bash
brew install gh go
gh auth login
```

Then summon the goose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ready-to-review/goose.git
cd goose && make run
```

## Known Issues

- Blocking logic is a WIP (we're working on it)
- Linux/BSD/Windows support is theoretical at best
- The goose may not stop honking until you review your PRs

## Pricing

This tool is part of the [CodeGroove](https://codegroove.dev) developer acceleration platform:
- **Forever free** for open-source repositories
- Low-cost fee TBD for access to private repos (the goose needs to eat)

## Privacy

Your GitHub token used to fetch PR metadata but we never store it anywhere. GitHub data is retained strictly for caching purposes with a 20-day maximum TTL.
